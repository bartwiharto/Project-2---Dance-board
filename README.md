# Project-2---Dance-board

Dancer project board. A project board for dancers so that they can put their inspirations(teams and choreographers) and songs to choreograph to make their life easier.

In this app, the user would be able to:

1. Input song that user wants to choreograph to.
2. Input choreographers who inspires them.
3. Input Team performances from competitions for blocking inspirations.


This project is definitely a challenge for me because Unit 2 is something that I've never dealt with before and unfortunately the syntax is not something that can be figure out easily.

I had to relearn Node.JS and everything else on Wednesday of project 2 week so I definitely knew that completing the assignment would be a miracle.

By the due date, I could only finish the C in CRUD and didn't have time to use YouTube API as I had planned, and I had to do my styling last minute.

But I figured, the most important thing would be that I actually understood a little more about Unit 2. Not perfectly, but at least it is a step up than at the beginning of project 2.
